Purpose of this application is to solve the problem of using excel sheets or any other means of managing Agile scrum methodology 

&lt;BR&gt;


Following are some thoughts I have: 

&lt;BR&gt;


# Idea is to create a google app engine project (Boilerplate + Webapp2 + Python). 

&lt;BR&gt;


# Easy to use on all mobile devices as well.

&lt;BR&gt;



Functionality: 

&lt;BR&gt;


# Product backlogs 

&lt;BR&gt;


# Sprint backlog (Resources,Sprint planning,burndown charts) 

&lt;BR&gt;


# Retros 

&lt;BR&gt;


# Teams and Resources 

&lt;BR&gt;
